# AI Wordle Solver with Reinforcement Learning

The goal is to implement and evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms on a gymnasium environment for playing the Wordle game with reinforcement learning agents. The algorithms being tested are Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The evaluation involves training these models on the Wordle gymnasium environment and comparing their performance based on mean reward over a series of training steps. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of each algorithm, providing valuable insights into their applicability for solving the Wordle game within the typical 6 guesses and having an average success rate of 3 guesses.
