    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  This repo is assuming you want to do (1).  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the Gradescope proposal for that instead of using this repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "We would like to create a clone of the famous Wordle New York Times brain teaser. The user will be given 2 options: to compete against an AI opponent, or to watch the AI try to complete the Wordle successfully. The goal of the game is in a sense is to display how AI is a worthy opponent to anyone playing Wordle. With the game, will come two different game modes, in which one the AI only mode is a single wordle screen whereas the competetive mode will feature a split-screen with the AI screen being censored. We would like to implement reinforcement learning to train an agent that will solve the wordle **better** on average that a human opponent, which would have to better than ~ 4 guesses. We think that this a fun and clever demonstration of the power of AI and its ingenuity.\n"

    "We would like to develop an agent using reinforcement learning that can successfully solve Wordle. Upon doing some research on these agents, we discovered a few arrticles that help show which methods are best to employ. In an agent designed by Andrew Ho, he utilized the A2C algorithm, which acheived 99% effectiveness <a name=\"tettamanti\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#tettamantinote).
